            <h2 class="mb-4">Our History</h2>
            <p>
                The Proprietor of the Thomas Adewumi University (Decrown West Africa Company Limited) undertook to
                establish a University as a logical progression of his efforts in the provision of qualitative
                University education at the primary and secondary school levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vision of Decrown West Africa Company Limited to develop the necessary infrastructure for education
                at the primary and secondary levels arose in 1991. That vision resulted in the establishment of Prime
                Time Nursery and Primary School in 1996 and Thomas Adewumi International College (TAICO) in 1997. These
                schools have made tremendous impacts on the lives of young Nigerians.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2006, Thomas Adewumi International College was voted the ‘Best Post Primary School in Nigeria’.
                Unfortunately, most of the graduates of Thomas Adewumi International College cannot continue in the
                excellent traditions of quality established at the schools as they seek to pursue higher education. They
                are assimilated in the existing national system, and those who can afford it migrate to other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the issues associated with quality, the proprietor of Thomas Adewumi University is aware
                of the frustration being encountered by secondary school graduates in accessing university education.
                These twin factors, coupled with the vision to raise future leaders for Nigeria and mankind in general,
                have informed the decision of Decrown West Africa Company Limited to crown its achievements in the
                provision of education with the establishment of the Thomas Adewumi University.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ethos of the Thomas Adewumi University is excellence, and the institution aims to become a major key
                player in the delivery of university education of the highest quality in Nigeria, as well as to produce
                graduates that would benefit themselves and be the human capital for the rapid and much-needed
                socio-economic development of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attainment of this goal is a major challenge and a serious commitment, which the Thomas Adewumi
                University expects to achieve through careful planning and adequate deployment of human and material
                resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The proprietor of the Thomas Adewumi University approached the National Universities Commission in 2008
                to commence procedures for obtaining a license for the University. The proprietor obtained the
                application form for the establishment of a private university in Nigeria from the NUC in 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Directors of Decrown West Africa Company Limited also constituted a Planning and Implementation
                Committee to midwife the process of obtaining the license so that the University could commence academic
                activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Federal Government of Nigeria licensed TAU as a Private University on 8th April, 2021.
